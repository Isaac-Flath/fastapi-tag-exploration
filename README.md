## Credit

Thanks to Jeremy Howard for creating [fasttags](https://fastcore.fast.ai/xml) and Daniel Roy-Greenfeld for exploring bringing that to fastapi with [fastapi-tags](https://github.com/pydanny/fastapi-tags), both of which this is built on top of.

## Is this a good idea?

🤷‍♂️ - i'm just goofing around having fun with an idea at this point.  There's some things I really like, and some things I don't really like about it.  But I think it's a direction worth exploring!
